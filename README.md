## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project: Mental Disorders Dataset

# Overview

This project focuses on conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about various mental disorders. The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the prevalence of different mental disorders and explore trends over time.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains information about mental disorders across different entities, years, and demographic groups. It consists of 6420 entries and includes the following columns:

Entity: Name of the entity (e.g., country, region).
Code: Code representing the entity (e.g., ISO country code).
Year: Year of observation.
Schizophrenia disorders: Share of population affected by schizophrenia.
Depressive disorders: Share of population affected by depressive disorders.
Anxiety disorders: Share of population affected by anxiety disorders.
Bipolar disorders: Share of population affected by bipolar disorders.
Eating disorders: Share of population affected by eating disorders.
The dataset is provided in a CSV format and can be found in the Mh.csv file.

# Tools and Libraries
The analysis was performed using Python programming language and various libraries, including:

Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

# Files
data.csv: The dataset used for analysis.
notebook.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and detailed analysis.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
# Analysis
The analysis includes the following steps:

Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, data cleaning, and data transformation.
Descriptive statistics: Summary statistics, distribution of variables, and visualizations.
Exploratory data analysis: Visualizing relationships, exploring correlations, and identifying patterns.
Key findings and insights: Summarizing the main observations and insights gained from the analysis.
Usage
# To replicate or explore the analysis:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/anuescapist/mental-wellness-analytics/tree/main.
Install the required libraries:
1. pip install Python3.
2. jupyter note book.
3. while working on library frist time you need to install { pandas, numpy, metaplot, Seaborn } before import need to install in jupyter

Open and run the Jupyter Notebook notebook.ipynb to view the analysis.
# Conclusion
This EDA project provides valuable insights into the prevalence of different mental disorders across entities and over time. Further analysis or modeling could be conducted based on these insights.
